          Samsung released it’s new Galaxy Z Fold 2. The Fold had durability
          issues in the past with many more problems on it’s back. Did Samsung
          solve all of them? Let’s find out.
          <br />
          The Z Fold 2 has re-designed the hinge mechanism to be snappier and
          uses a display with ultra-thin glass elements in it which is more
          resistant to scratches. So it should give you this basic idea: it is
          more powerful, it is more fluid with a 120 Hz refresh rate with an
          inside screen size of 7.6 inches and outside 6.1 inches. Cameras may
          not be the best Samsung has ever produced, but it is satisfactory.
          Samsung has released an advertisement in 2013 showing a foldable phone
          - this is pretty much it.
        </p>

              All right, that sounds pretty cool, doesn’t it? But is it a wise
              model? Let's see.
              <br />
              <br />
              We have two screens here – one on the front and one on the back,
              but practically how many can we use at a time? – one. We have two
              camera sets – one on the back, one on the front. But how many do
              we use at once? – one. We have seen Huawei's folding phone, which
              does a better job - it has a single screen, single-camera set up.
              So, it not only takes excellent rear shots but also takes amazing
              selfies using the main camera set up. Since no. of screens we use
              here is less obviously battery consumed here is low as well. So
              Huawei does a better job at folding phones than Samsung? Not
              exactly. Huawei comes with just a 60 Hz refresh rate and the main
              problem being Huawei doesn’t support Google Android. So, no google
              services, which I think is pretty bad.

          Huwaei foldable phone was 11 mm thick whereas Samsung Z2 is 15.5 mm
          thick. The Z2 has inside screen comes with a 120 Hz refresh rate
          display whereas outside display comes with just a 60 Hz, like
          seriously? We can experience a jaw-dropping user experience in 90 or
          120 Hz - So, 60 Hz is low and is something you do not want to
          experience all of a sudden from a 120 Hz display.
          <br />
          Alright, the main factor – price, Samsung's first foldable mobile was
          launched for 1980 USD(that is ultra-expensive for something so
          fragile). So, I don't think I have to give you an idea of how
          expensive the second guy would be.
        </p>
        <p>
          So is this a bad phone? Definitely not - but it could have been more
          for the price we pay. These issues may be little, but for something
          that will stick with us for two or more years, you do not want to
          regret it.

        <p>
          Now onto the bigger problem, does the world need a foldable phone? –
          my answer is not yet. Smartphones are getting better even at
          affordable prices with amazing durability and large displays. No
          matter how durable a foldable phone is, it is still bulliable. If I
          wanted a screen that big I would just go for a portable laptop with a
          good display which would cost me half the price I would have to pay
          for this not so good display. Foldable phones may be the future, but
          the company needs to listen to what customer needs and what can be
          changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do we recommend it? – I don’t think a significant part of society
          would like the idea of foldable phones but if you belong to the
          remaining zone - I would say, you better wait for a year because even
          though this mobile is bulliable, it indeed overcame the problems the
          previous one posed. So, next-gen would probably listen to what
          customer wants and modify it in a way that we like.
