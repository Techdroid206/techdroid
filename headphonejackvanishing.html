          Bluetooth earphones, who uses them? Few, who actually like using them
          and few, out of Compulsion. How much does this 3.5mm jack costs? To be
          honest not more than some 1000 bucks. But when companies are
          manufacturing some thousands of such phones, this price comes way down
          to less than 25% of its individual cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          IPhone 7 was the first mobile to come out without headphone Jack.
          Missing of this jack started in Android at first with flagship mobiles
          knowing the fact that flagship users can spend few more bucks on TWS.
          <br />
          Alright, that's fine, but the real problem is it started approaching
          upper mid range market as well like one plus nord or real me X3
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's first talk about advantages which companies claim to be useful
          by removing this - <br />
          - improving battery <br />
          - slim design <br />
          - better water resistant <br />
          But is it really the thing? No it's not. It actually makes things
          complex.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have paid proper attention you might have noticed that brands
          release their new TWS or Bluetooth ear phones whenever they remove
          headphone jack. Few of you might support this saying they're providing
          a solution for absence of headphone jack,but here's the thing, most of
          the TWS doesn't provide you all the features unless you're using the
          parent brand mobile phone. Obviously this is pure business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bluetooth earphones come in many ways, they come as neckbands, air
          buds, TWS etc. But do they provide the best sound quality out there as
          wired earphone? Well personally I'm a user of Bluetooth speaker,
          wireless earphones(2), wired earphones, but nothing matches the
          quality of sound quality produced by wired earphones unless you pay
          some huge amount. For example JBL c150 is so good that even 2999/-
          priced bluetooth tagg inferno can't beat the quality produced by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          So companies out there literally forcing and influencing it's users to
          switch to their products even though there's no absolute need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alright let's recall the advantages we talked about few mins ago.
          <br />
          - improved battery? Well some mere 50 or 100 mAh battery is not going
          to make any difference on a practical level. <br />
          - slim design? Well there's always a better way of doing things.
          <br />
          - water resistant? Many phones did come out with IP rated water
          resistant modules with inbuilt headphone jack, so obviously that's not
          a excuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well to conclude, why is it important? True bluetooth earphones are
          comfortable without much trouble offered in return, that really makes
          sense if we buy a flagship mobile. But the real problem here being
          it's entry into mid range market. Imagine buying a phone of 12,000
          rupees and spending some 5000/- rupees on TWS where you can't expect
          much from that because the Bluetooth version provided in mobile will
          obviously be a slow one for budget which won't give you the best
          output.If companies are trying to cut off jack then should add one c
          to 3.55 cable in the box which would make things easier to some
          extent.
