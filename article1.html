          OnePlus Nord, a mobile which has made people go absolutely crazy with
          its teasers. OnePlus has launched a new mobile – OnePlus Nord, which
          seems to stand out from the rest of the mid-tier region. Well along
          with its cousin, One plus buds it's gonna hit the market starting from
          August 4, 2020. Well, the hype is for real, but what about the phone
          itself? Is it special? Maybe it is, let’s know why.
        </p>
        <p>
          What exactly makes this mobile a bit unique? well, one of the perks of
          being a mid-range(20k-30k)(around 400 USD in general) phone is they
          don’t have the best hardware you can find in the market. It's more or
          like assembling the hardware pieces available within the budget, but
          OnePlus has been trying something different this time with this,
          OnePlus actually started off as a mid-tier region and then occupied
          flagship status leaving behind mid-ranged mobiles, so this time they
          have considered mid-range users and also their flagship status in
          mind. So the user pretty much gets the flagship experience but with
          some compromises which are pretty much negligible, to be honest.
        </p>
        <p>Alright, let's get into phone straight away :</p>
        <p>
          This phone with a 6.44-inch AMOLED display has a smaller border
          around. It runs on OXYGEN OS, with two punch-hole cameras in
          front(wide-angle and ultra-wide-angle lens ) which looks decent and
          rear camera has a quad-camera set up. Even though the other mobiles in
          the same price range have the same chipset snapdragon 765G, Nord feels
          faster because of its 90hz refresh rate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nord has a decent battery of 4113 mAH and supports 5G in two sims with
          sim tray protected by some rubber kind of material making sure it is
          water-resistant to some extent, it has an inbuilt fingerprint
          sensor(square sensor, not the circular one like flagship containers)
          with different variants (6+64, 8+182, 12+526) in blue marble and grey
          onyx colours. It has a single speaker at the bottom of the phone and
          no headphone jack, it supports 30W fast charging ( wireless not
          available)

          Alright, you might have gotten a little idea of how good or bad this
          mobile is by now. <br /> <br>
          This is a decent mobile with some amazing features with the given
          budget and what stands out the most? Well, this guy comes with optical
          image stabilization which isn’t seen in a 400 USD segment before, so
          it stands out from its competitors. The cameras, even though they said
          they had gone with same one plus 8 sensors here, refinement of
          pictures, clearly, is different in both. But the colours (which one
          plus said can produce more than 16 million colours) in this mobile is
          just amazing, the ultra-wide sensor in front being a 32MP, it captures
          pretty good details in both dim and harsh lights. Well, when it comes
          to haptics many people may not be bothered by it, but here is the
          thing, haptics in flagship devices definitely stands out because of
          the user experience it provides. In general, haptics is an important
          field a company neglects in mid-tier and low range mobiles. But one
          plus did a very good job in handling this haptics here, they feel far
          better than any mid-range mobile out there. It can handle games like
          COD, up to 60 fps on medium settings with amazing graphics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alright, what drawbacks do we get by cutting down the price and
          providing a mobile with this decent features. Nord body on its side is
          not a metal, it’s a plastic coated with metal look-alike paint, so an
          extreme bending may lead to screen breakage since they had to make
          mobile very slim, they used copper cooling system inside which is
          situated nearby depth sensor. One field where there was a
          disappointment is the headphone jack. Yes, everyone is shifting to
          Bluetooth operated truly wireless earphones, but there is a majority
          of the portion out there still willing to have a headphone jack, at
          least they should have added a C to 3.5mm jack in the box. OnePlus
          actually came up with a different design of triple inverted
          right-angled triangle set up initially which was discarded and made to
          regular stereotyped OnePlus as not to lose their originality. Well,
          honestly that design was catchy and the colour was more attractive.

        <p>
            Well, this is all about OnePlus Nord, it does stand out in the market,
            do we suggest this? Well if you are little careful about your mobiles
            in general by not bending too much out of it, then we definitely do.
