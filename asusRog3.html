          Everytime Asus releases ROG mobile, it becomes the fastest mobile at
          that given point of time. It almost became a tradition at this
          point. Am I praising ROG series too much? Well latest ROG 3 is worth
          the praise.
        </p>
        <p>
          The box itself comes with some unique design which definitely stands
          out from any other unboxing opening experience.we get aero active
          cooler 3 inside for gaming. We get 30W hyper charger with USB C to
          headphone jack adapter(which every company should probably provide if
          they're planning to neglect headphone jack) along with USB C cable and
          few rubber ports to seal the phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alright, now for the phone itself, well its almost identical to it's
          previous generation with same identical substantial borders around the
          display.In the idea of making it look a bit cleaner, ROG 3 has lost
          its identity which is kind of a beast and aggressive when you look at
          previous version's body.Slanted buttons have become rounded buttons.
          Alright, these issues are negligible, you'll know why in a while.

          What changes exactly did they brought here from ROG 2, well they have
          literally brought out the best of every possible component out there
          and placed it in here making it an absolute beast.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>display has gone from 120 hz to 144 hz</li>
          <li>ram has gone from 12 gigs to 16 gigs</li>
          <li>storage speed ufs 3.0 to ufs 3.1.</li>
          <li>the camera from 4k to 8k</li>
          <li>
            the heat sink is 6 times larger now(so basically the cooler you get
            isn't actually needed, oh wait you might be needing an stand, so
            stick with it lol)
          </li>
          <li>improved speakers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          So basically they've improved everything which can't be seen but felt
          by actual usage. The speakers are so good that I won't hesitate to
          shout out that they are the best speakers attached to a smart phone
          right now.why smart phone's speakers are not that provided with deep
          base? To actually provide deep base the speaker have to pump lots of
          air which requires larger space, that's something smart phone
          practically can't do, so what asus has done here is they've come up
          with a software solution adding artificially extra base.And the
          haptics, the sensory experience you get out of it is just so good that
          you won't regret buying it even for a second
        </p>

        <p>
          Alright,let's talk about the killer feature of this mobile - gaming,
          even a person who isn't into gaming have a more or less idea about how
          good asus ROG series is for gaming
        </p>
        <p>
          Well there is a big debate out there regarding why every gaming
          phone's camera sucks, but this was changed with ROG 2 and it's
          completely vanished with ROG 3, the main camera here is an absolute
          beast, it even beats some of the modern day flagship in terms of
          picture crispness with pretty good details and you can take 8k videos
          at 30fps with stabilization(well, no kidding, this is the world's
          first smart phone that can do that)
        </p>
        <p>
          ROG 3 is most powerful mobile out there in market right now with
          world's first 865+ QSD chipset which is pretty much 10% faster than
          already super faster 865 chipset and cooling has gotten really good
          (there is an air vent, there is a vapor chamber, there's a graphite
          film) it comes with 6000 mAh, which is enormous and acts as a power
          bank as well
        </p>
        <p>
          Can you really take advantage of the 144hz display though? - when you
          play a game on pc you can adjust your frame rate according to your
          graphic card, but in Android the frame rate are locked by a particular
          game developer, so no matter how fast your mobile is it will still
          provide 60hz refresh rate, so we're not actually using that for
          gaming. So maybe the technology would mold in such a way that it'll
          set frame rate according to the mobile which is pretty much useful for
          a mobile like this.(maybe like MEMC where even 30 fps can be shown as
          something like 120 fps)
        </p>
        <p>
          Do we recommend it? - people in general won't buy one mobile for
          gaming and the other one for camera, that's where ROG 3 comes into the
          scene providing both, I hope that helps with your concern.
